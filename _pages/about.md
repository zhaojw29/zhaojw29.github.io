# Introduction

Hello! I am **Jiawen Zhao** (赵嘉雯), a **Junior Undergraduate Student** at **Sun Yat-sen University**, Guangzhou, China. 

My current research focuses on **Multi-Agent Systems** and **Video Understanding**. 

I am also deeply interested in **Vision-Language Analysis (VLA)** and **Agentic Reinforcement Learning (RL)** for my future research. I aim to build intelligent agents that can perceive, reason, and act in complex environments.

*(Project description based on resume context)*
Investigating methods to construct graphs across multiple videos for enhanced understanding and reasoning.

### Question-Aware Multi-Agent Long-Form Video Understanding
![TMM Paper](images/TMM.png)

*(Project description based on resume context)*
Developing a multi-agent framework to solve complex queries in long-form videos by leveraging question-aware decomposition and reasoning.

## Future Interests

My future research will explore the intersection of **Embodied AI** and **Foundation Models**, specifically:
- **Vision-Language Actions (VLA):** Bridging the gap between visual perception and robotic control.
- **Agentic RL:** Developing autonomous agents capable of long-horizon planning and adaptability.
